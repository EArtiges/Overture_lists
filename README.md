# Overture Admin Boundary Tools

A multi-page Streamlit application for working with administrative boundaries from [Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/) data. Create boundary lists, map divisions to CRM accounts, build targeted client lists, define organizational hierarchies, auto-generate lists, and visualize saved data on interactive maps.

## Overview

This application provides six integrated tools:

### 📋 List Builder
Create and manage collections of administrative boundaries:
- Browse hierarchical divisions via cascading dropdowns (countries as Level 1)
- Visualize boundaries on interactive maps
- Build named lists with descriptions
- Save lists to SQLite database
- Duplicate detection via MD5 hash (name + type)
- Persistent storage across sessions

### 🏢 CRM Mapping
Map Overture divisions to your CRM accounts with persistent storage:
- Select divisions using hierarchical navigation
- Assign custom fields: System ID, Account Name, Admin Level
- SQLite persistence with cached division geometry
- View, delete, and manage mappings
- Link geographic territories to business data

### 👥 CRM Client List Builder
Build targeted client lists from pre-mapped territories:
- Filter clients by country and mapped territories
- Visualize client territories on interactive maps
- Create and manage client lists
- Save lists to SQLite database
- Load mock client data from clients.json
- Leverage existing CRM mappings for targeted marketing

### 🔗 Organizational Hierarchy
Define reporting relationships between divisions:
- Select parent and child divisions
- Build "reports_to" and "collaborates_with" relationships
- SQLite persistence for organizational structures
- View and manage all relationships
- Foundation for admin hierarchy auto-list generation

### 🤖 Auto List Builder
Automatically generate lists from hierarchical relationships:
- Generate from spatial hierarchies (child divisions via Overture data)
- Generate from admin hierarchies (organizational relationships)
- Select parent division as starting point
- Automatic collection of all children
- Save generated lists to database

### 🗺️ List Visualizer
Visualize saved lists on interactive maps:
- View all list items simultaneously
- Color-coded multi-layer maps
- Toggle individual item visibility
- Supports both boundary and CRM client lists
- Load any saved list for visual exploration

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Streamlit multi-page application (6 pages)
- **Data Query:** DuckDB (queries Parquet files directly from S3)
- **Data Source:** Overture Maps Foundation divisions dataset
- **Storage:**
  - **Unified SQLite database** (app_data.db) for all persistence
  - Single DatabaseStorage class handles all data operations
  - Tables: divisions (cache), lists, list_divisions, list_clients, crm_mappings, relationships
  - Foreign key constraints and CASCADE deletes
  - PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON for constraint enforcement
  - Mock client data loaded from clients.json
- **Map Rendering:** Folium with geometry simplification for performance
- **Code Structure:** Shared components and utilities for DRY architecture

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access the app at http://localhost:8501
```

The application will mount volumes for persistent storage:
- `./data` - SQLite database (app_data.db) - **ALL persistent data**
- `./crm_data` - Mock CRM client data (clients.json)
- `./pages` - Application pages

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## Configuration

### Parquet Data Path

By default, the app connects to the **latest** Overture Maps release on S3 using the **divisions** theme:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/<latest>/theme=divisions/type=division/*.parquet
```
The latest release is looked up from Overture's [STAC catalog](https://stac.overturemaps.org/catalog.json) (falling back to listing the S3 bucket) and cached for 6 hours, so new monthly releases are picked up without any code change.

**Important:** The `admins` theme was deprecated in mid-2024 and replaced with `divisions`. Use the divisions theme for current releases.

#### Path Structure
- **Division records:** `theme=divisions/type=division`
- **Area geometries:** `theme=divisions/type=division_area` (used for map rendering)
- **Legacy releases (pre-July 2024):** `theme=admins/type=*/`

#### Release Versions
Overture releases data monthly and only keeps the most recent few releases on S3, so pinned release paths eventually stop working. See [available releases](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/) (format: `YYYY-MM-DD.N`).

To pin a release or use local data, set a path explicitly:

**Via Environment Variable:**
```bash
export OVERTURE_PARQUET_PATH="path/to/your/data.parquet"
```

**Via Docker Compose:**
Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
environment:
  - OVERTURE_PARQUET_PATH=your/custom/path
```

**Via UI:**
Use the "Parquet Data Path" input in the sidebar (changes persist during session only)

## Development

### Key Design Patterns

**Multi-page Architecture:** Streamlit automatically detects pages in the `pages/` directory and creates sidebar navigation.

**Shared Components:** Common UI elements (map rendering, boundary selector, session state) extracted to `src/shared_components.py` to eliminate duplication and ensure consistency.

**Caching:** All DuckDB queries use `@st.cache_data` to avoid re-querying Parquet files on every Streamlit rerun.

**Lazy Loading:** Geometries are only loaded when viewing on the map, never bulk-loaded into memory.

**Session State Management:**
- Each page maintains its own state keys (e.g., `crm_selected_boundary` vs `selected_boundary`)
- Common state managed via shared initialization functions
- Proper cleanup on country/selection changes

**Data Persistence:**
- Unified SQLite database for all application data (app_data.db)
- Single DatabaseStorage class with context manager pattern
- Foreign key constraints and CASCADE deletes
- Hash-based duplicate detection for lists (MD5 of name + type)
- Transaction management via context manager (__enter__/__exit__)
- Cached division geometry to avoid re-querying Overture
- Easy migration path to PostgreSQL or cloud databases

**Performance Optimization:**
- Geometry simplification: `ST_Simplify(geometry, 0.001)` reduces polygon complexity by ~100 meters tolerance
- Separate queries for metadata vs geometries
- Cached query results

### Data Schema

The app uses Overture Maps divisions dataset with schema:

**Division records (`type=division`):**
- `id`: Division ID (unique identifier)
- `names.primary`: Display name
- `subtype`: Division type (country, region, province, etc.)
- `country`: ISO country code
- `parent_division_id`: Parent division for hierarchy

**Division areas (`type=division_area`):**
- `division_id`: References division record
- `geometry`: Polygon/MultiPolygon geometries

### Adding Custom Fields

The page configuration pattern uses variables for titles and emojis:

```python
page_title = "Your Page Title"
page_emoji = "🎯"
st.set_page_config(
    page_title=page_title,
    page_icon=page_emoji,
    layout="wide"
)
```

## Limitations

This is a proof-of-concept with intentional scope limitations:
- Single-user tool (no authentication)
- No multi-user access or list sharing
- List Visualizer can show multiple items, but List Builder shows one at a time
- No map-based selection (dropdown-only navigation)
- Client data must be manually placed in `crm_data/clients.json` (mock data)
- No live CRM integration
- No export functionality yet (all data in SQLite)

## Recent Enhancements (Implemented)

✅ **Unified SQLite Database** - Migrated all persistence to single SQLite database with unified DatabaseStorage class

✅ **Six Tools** - Added Organizational Hierarchy, Auto List Builder, and List Visualizer pages

✅ **Countries as Divisions** - Improved cascading dropdown to treat countries as Level 1 divisions with proper division_ids

✅ **Hash-based Duplicate Detection** - Lists use MD5 hash of name+type to prevent duplicates

✅ **Relationship Management** - Define organizational hierarchies with reports_to and collaborates_with relationships

✅ **Auto-List Generation** - Generate lists from spatial hierarchies (Overture parent-child) or admin hierarchies (user-defined relationships)

✅ **Multi-Item Visualization** - List Visualizer shows all items on map with color-coding and toggle visibility

✅ **Context Manager Pattern** - Proper transaction management with commit/rollback and st.rerun() safety

## Future Enhancements

When migrating from POC to production:
- Add multi-user support and authentication
- Implement list sharing and permissions
- Add bulk operations and advanced filtering
- Migrate to cloud storage (Azure Blob, S3) or managed database (PostgreSQL, Azure SQL)
- Enable full list visualization on map (multiple boundaries at once)
- Add spatial queries (boundaries within radius, overlaps, etc.)
- Support live CRM integration via API
- Add batch import from CSV for client data and mappings

## Troubleshooting

### "No files found that match the pattern" or "No countries found" error

**Common cause:** Using the deprecated `admins` theme or incorrect path pattern.

**Solution:**
1. If you set `OVERTURE_PARQUET_PATH`, make sure it uses the `divisions` theme, or unset it to use the latest release automatically:
   ```
   s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/<release>/theme=divisions/type=division/*.parquet
   ```

2. If you pinned a release, verify it still exists on the [Overture releases page](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/) (older releases are removed from S3)

3. Check network access to S3 if using remote data

### Map rendering is slow

**Solution:** The app already uses geometry simplification. If still slow:
- Adjust simplification tolerance in `src/shared_components.py` (increase from 0.001)
- Check network bandwidth for S3 downloads
- Consider caching geometries locally

### Sidebar navigation not appearing

**Common cause:** Docker volume not mounted for `pages/` directory

**Solution:**
1. Verify `docker-compose.yml` includes:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./pages:/app/pages
   ```

2. Restart containers: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

### Pages show `st.set_page_config` error

**Cause:** Only the main `app.py` should call `st.set_page_config()` in the root level. Pages can call it but must do so before any other Streamlit commands.

**Solution:** Ensure page files have `st.set_page_config()` as the first Streamlit call, right after imports.

### Docker volume permissions
```bash
# Ensure data directories have correct permissions
chmod 777 crm_data data
```

### Database file permissions

**Symptom:** "Unable to open database file" or permission errors

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod 666 data/app_data.db
```

### Transaction rollback issues

**Symptom:** Data not persisting even though no error shown

**Cause:** st.rerun() called inside DatabaseStorage context manager causes exception, triggering rollback

**Solution:** Ensure st.rerun() is called AFTER the context manager exits
```python
# CORRECT:
with DatabaseStorage() as db:
    db.save_mapping(...)
# Context exits here, commit happens
st.rerun()  # Safe

# WRONG:
with DatabaseStorage() as db:
    db.save_mapping(...)
    st.rerun()  # Causes rollback!
```

### Client List Builder shows no clients

**Symptom:** "No clients found" or empty dropdown in Client List Builder

**Cause:** Either no client data in `crm_data/clients.json` or no CRM mappings exist for those clients.

**Solution:**
1. Verify `crm_data/clients.json` exists and contains valid client data
2. Check that clients have the required fields: system_id, account_name, country, custom_admin_level
3. Ensure you've created CRM mappings in the CRM Mapping page
4. Client List Builder only shows clients that have been mapped to divisions
